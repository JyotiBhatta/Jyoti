    Everyone. I'm Nepali and wants to learn more about Nepali music. I haven't found any detailed research on our music so I hope you guys could help me.

    Nepal is multilingual, multicultural, multiethnic, etc country. So we have wide varieties of music.
    <br>
    Sastriya sangeet (classical music)
    <br>
    Our classical music is very similar to Indian one but we have our own uniqueness. I find nepali classical to be much more sweeter than Indian one. It might just be my bias.
    <br>
    Here are some nepali classical for you guys to analyse:

    I have heard that Indian classical doesn't have harmony. Is it true for nepali classical too? Since, we also use sur and taal system it might be. What difference do you find between Indian classical, nepali classical and Pakistani classical? Do you find some Tibetan or Chinese influences?
    
    Panche baja/naumati baja
    
    This form of music is dear and special to me because my ancestors used to play it. Panche baja literally means five set of musical instruments and naumati means 9 sets of musical instruments. It is usually played in wedding and religious rituals.
    
    Here are some panche and naumati baja:

    Newari music
    
    It is one of my favourite. It came from Kathmandu valley and have both Indian and Chinese/Tibetan influences. They even have music for all seasons. In Nepal we have 6 seasons instead of four.

    Here are Newari musics:

    Folk music
    <br>
    There are so many ethnic group its too much time consuming to categorize them in different groups so I'm presenting it in folk category.
    <br>
